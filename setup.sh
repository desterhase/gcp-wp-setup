# TODO(don): decide on one branch that is going to be pinned for production.  release, or something like that.

# TODO(don): maintain two copies of the wordpress mysql database, one for production, one for staging, and a command to spin one up and tear one down based off any random branch if I am testing something?

# NOTE(don): When committing to the staging branch, then the staging deployment is updated.  there should be an option though to have changes directly to the working tree be updated in the deployment as they are being made, i.e CSS changes.  i want the feedback loop to be as short as possible.

# NOTE(don): Are there any changes outside of the themes and plugins files for thegreenroomsac.com?  If there aren't, can I maintain a repo for gm/plugins, gm/themes, bb/plugins, bb/themes?



# wp-files on production server      wp-plugin & theme files in repo
